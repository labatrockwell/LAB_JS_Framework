// WHAT THIS APP SHOULD DO

Move a group of 6 divs around in a circle on the screen.

// WHAT TO LOOK AT

In general this app tries to abstract out and create a sprite 
class (Agents.js). After agents are created they can be assigned 
behaviors which alter the Agent properties. These agents can then 
be added to groups. Behaviors can alter both Groups and Agents.
